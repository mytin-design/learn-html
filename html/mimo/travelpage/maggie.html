    <h1>My response to maggie's dad passing on</h1>
    <h2>Issues</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>I was not there for her when her dad passed on. She remembers that. In fact you knew she would never forget that, and trully she hasnt and will never.</li>
        <li>I think i understand her because my dad left us. Not literally equivalent. I have a theory, of how it feels but i have no idea in reality.</li>
        <li>I was in her business too much. Just like my mother does. which suffocates me. I suffocated her too.</li>
        <li>To me it looks like care, to her it looks like over-clingy. She hates it. I hate it when my mother does it.</li>
        <li>So I am offeded when some is too involved in my business, why should I not see it coming, that someone will be offended if I am too into their business.</li>
        <li>Our relationship is fragile.</li>
        <li>In fact i do not think there is a relationship. Based on;</li>
        <li>One, she says i broke her heart. "It felt like being dumped". As such she resolved to not give a shit about me.</li>
        <li>Two; I failed to attend her father's funeral. It will forever be engraved in her heart.</li>
        <li>Do i care too much, that it is intoxicating?</li>
        <li>But how did I survive with linsey for so long? How did we ever work out? Its the best thing that has ever happened to my life.</li>
        <li>But why does someone being soo into my business offend me? Why does it offend maggie? Is too much caring wrong? Too much of anything is poisonous - too much kindness, too much love - too much care?</li>
        <li>Do you think there is anything left to salvage between you and maggie?</li>
        <li>This is why i hate getting attached. It takes forever to get attached. And when it happens, the person leaves, due to my actions. So its all me. But how comes it always ends like this,</li>
        <li>Right now i feel like deleting her number and letting her be. Forget her. Let her cease to exist.</li>
        <li>She is smart, and we vibe, but she is not the kind of girlfriend i want. So i would never date her. Basically she would always be a friend. And this friendship has been compromised by current state of our hearts, emotions</li>
        <li>But what do we do when we are not certain, we wait.</li>
    </ol>
