        Quick hummus recipe

    This <a href="recipes.html" title="This is info about recipes">recipe</a> makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.

    Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.

    <h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>

    1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)
    175g of tahini
    6 sundried tomatoes
    Half a red pepper
    A pinch of cayenne pepper
    1 clove of garlic
    A dash of olive oil

    <p>Instructions; would you want to see the list of <a href="learn.html#ingredients">Ingredients</a></p>

    Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely
    Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely
    Add all the ingredients into a food processor
    Process all the ingredients into a paste.
    If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time
    If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time

    For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.

    <h4>Storage</h4>
    <p>You can locate certain <a href="#ingredients">Ingredients</a> In our storage lockers.</p>

    Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.

    Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.
